            Hello! My name is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e91e63;">Jashan Sahasrabudhe</span>, and I am an aspiring <em>engineer</em>. 
            I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology, from VIT Vellore. 
            Each day, I am driven by a desire to explore new horizons, learn, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I believe in the power of collaboration and creativity. 
            During my journey, I have worked on various <strong style="font-weight: bolder; color: #4caf50;">projects</strong>, ranging from software development to innovative tech solutions. 
            I love brainstorming ideas and turning them into reality. 
            One of my most cherished projects is a platform that enables students and professionals to collaborate and focus on their goals. 
            It highlights my belief that technology and the rise of the use of machine learning in today's society can make a huge difference.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Apart from academics, I am deeply passionate about <strong style="font-weight: bolder; color: #4caf50;">music</strong>. 
            I'm a musician who loves exploring different sounds, with the guitar being my go-to instrument. 
            I've picked up 10 others over the years—like <i>drums, keyboard, and saxophone</i>—just to keep things interesting. 
            <b>Music</b> is my way of unwinding and connecting with people.
